Usage: sla [COMMAND NAME] [COMMAND ARGS]
The arguments depend on the command:

sla run [SCRIPT NAME]
Runs a script from the database.

sla add [SCRIPT FILE] [SCRIPT EXECUTION COMMAND]
Adds a script to the script database.
    
    The [SCRIPT FILE] must have execution permissions (or at least be able to
    be executed by the [SCRIPT EXECUTION COMMAND])
    
    The [SCRIPT EXECUTION COMMAND] is a string that contains the command that
    need to be written to execute the script. When writting this command the
    you have to place "..." where the [SCRIPT FILE] would be placed.

    An example of adding a python program to the database would be:

        sla add hello.py "python3 ..."

    Note: When adding a script to the database the extension will be deleted,
    so you can not have both hello.py and hello.sh in the same sla database.

sla del [SCRIPT NAME]
Deletes a script from the script database
